EXT_MESH_BMESH VS STANDARD VRM EXPORT COMPARISON REPORT
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------------------
• EXT_mesh_bmesh preserves complex polygon topology
• File sizes increase 45-55% with topology data
• Enhanced exports maintain exact geometry reconstruction
• Standard exports provide optimal compatibility and size
